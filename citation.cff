  This repository contains the materials for the student talk
  "Change Point Detection in Irregularly Sampled Time Series:
  AGN Light Curves Toy Example," presented at the XXI Escuela
  de Verano en Matemáticas Discretas (CMM 2026), Universidad
  Adolfo Ibáñez, Viña del Mar, Chile. The project presents a
  pedagogical application of changepoint detection techniques
  to an AGN light curve using Astropy and the `ruptures`
  package. The implementation includes PELT-based segmentation
  and binary segmentation with quadratic + harmonic regression
  for the piecewise model.
